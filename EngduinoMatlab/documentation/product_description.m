%% Product Description
% MATLAB® Support Package for Engduino® Hardware enables you to use MATLAB®
% to communicate with the Engduino® hardware over a USB cable. It also
% supports Bluetooth serial communication when an
% additional Bluetooth module is connected to the Engduino® hardware. This
% package requires the Engduino® hardware to be flashed with a Protocol
% program which, will allow MATLAB communication with the Engduino® hardware. Please refer to
% the <setup_and_configuration.html Setup and Configuration> Guide for
% more details on how to setup and connect Engduino® with MATLAB®.
%
% This approach allows you:
%
% * Start programming right away.
% * Work in MATLAB for interactive development and debugging.
% * Use all the existing functions available on MATLAB for your development.
% * Access peripheral devices and sensors connected to the Engduino hardware.
% * Carry out complex signal processing and calculation in your
% development.
%
% This support package supports Engduino V3, Engduino V2, Engduino V1 board.
